# Predicting-employee-salary-using-linear-regression
The following code shows the mechanism by which the employee's salary can be predicted through the use of linear graphs. The proposed model tries to find a mathematical formula that links the inputs (which are the characteristics that distinguish the employee) with his salary and therefore, depending on the available data, a mathematical formula is found that allows the possibility of Forecasting employee salary.
